# PerfectAttendance
Queries for Wanco's perfect attendance system.

There are three queries. The date range that all of them cover is supposed to be set by HR through Vision Plex
- The first query finds all clock in/out sessions that still have the "Scheduled" or "Absent-No Call" label
- The second query finds work days in which an employee didn't work their full 8 hours
- The third query finds all employees that are qualified for the perfect attendance bonuses

All three queries have Visionplex screens.
